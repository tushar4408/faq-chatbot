Question,Answer
What is AI?,"AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn."
What is Machine Learning?,"Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses data and algorithms to enable systems to learn and improve."
What is deep learning?,"Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers."
What is NLP?,"NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which helps machines understand human language."
What is a chatbot?,"A chatbot is an AI application that can simulate conversation with users via text or voice."
What are neural networks?,"Neural networks are a set of algorithms designed to recognize patterns, modeled after the human brain."
What is supervised learning?,"Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data."
What is unsupervised learning?,"Unsupervised learning uses data without labels to identify hidden patterns."
What is reinforcement learning?,"Reinforcement learning is an ML technique where an agent learns by interacting with its environment."
What is overfitting?,"Overfitting happens when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data."
What is underfitting?,"Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in data."
What is accuracy?,"Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to total observations."
What is precision?,"Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives."
What is recall?,"Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives."
What is F1 score?,"F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall."
What is data preprocessing?,"Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and preparing raw data for model building."
What is feature selection?,"Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features from the dataset."
What is model evaluation?,"Model evaluation measures the performance of a model using various metrics."
What is cross-validation?,"Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate models by training on subsets of data and validating on others."
What is a confusion matrix?,"A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate classification models."
What is computer vision?,"Computer vision enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data."
What is image classification?,"Image classification is the task of assigning a label to an input image."
What is object detection?,"Object detection identifies and locates objects in images or videos."
What is transfer learning?,"Transfer learning is reusing a pre-trained model on a new but related task."
What is gradient descent?,"Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize loss in machine learning models."
